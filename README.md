# Raccoon-Alarm

This is a project created by Matthew Chen and Jack Meehan. An issue that we have ran into before is when animals such as raccoons eat trash bags that have been left out before someone took them to the dumpster. 
There are many animal and pest detectors and repellents that exist but many are often either very expensive or very large and bulky. Why fix the problem by taking out the bags when you can over-engineer a solution?
